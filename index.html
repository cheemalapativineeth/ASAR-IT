          <br>
          In some societies, women are still discriminated on their gender. They are not given the same right as men. Women are still paid less, expected to cook, clean etc. Women are still strict by their culture and family. As women can’t go out at night or with the guys. Some Cambodian women are determined by their parents or husband. They still not allowed women to work or study far away from their home because they believed that women are weaker than men and some husbands get jealously. In additionally, some women in Cambodia married in young age and some also forced to married by their parents. Women’s empowerment is really needed in the societies. It’s so important for women self-esteem and also for societies.
         <br>Our dedicated education team provides programs to our community members. These programs are targeted at children from ages five – 18, and supplements their public school education. Not only this, we are also committed to continuously educating our staff members who are dedicated to excelling in their roles.
         <br>
         The children in our community don’t have access to books at their homes, whilst supplies at public school are very limited. As a result, many students don’t know basic Khmer and are not able to think creatively and independently. The library provides a safe environment for children living in poverty to learn, study and play every day.
